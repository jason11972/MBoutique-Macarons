## Code Setup Details

#### 1. Fork Repository
> Forking the repository or Repo will give you a copy of this repo under your own GitHub user account. We will be starting with a Learning-Fuze account repo.

> Click the Fork icon in the top right corner if you have not done so already

#### 2. Copy locally (Clone the Repo)
> `git clone https://github.com/[your-user-name]/mboutique.git`

> <b>[your-user-name] should be replaced with your exact github account name</b>

> Cloning a repository is making a copy of the repo that was forked on github.com/[your_account_name]/mboutique (in the step above) and saving it too your computer (Local Machine).

> Below are the assignment links that will contain further information about creating feature sets (branches) and how to submit your assignments.
